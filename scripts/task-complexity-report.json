      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Project Setup and Configuration",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js 14 project setup into specific technical steps including initialization, configuration of TypeScript, Tailwind CSS setup, and development environment configuration with Git, ESLint and Prettier.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multiple configuration steps that are foundational but straightforward for experienced developers. The complexity comes from ensuring all components (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui) are properly integrated and configured together."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Layout and Navigation Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the layout and navigation implementation into distinct components including responsive header creation, footer development, theme switching functionality, and mobile navigation adaptation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires creating multiple UI components that work together cohesively across device sizes. The implementation of persistent dark mode and responsive design adds complexity, but these are well-documented patterns in Next.js and Tailwind."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "About Me Page Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the About Me page implementation into content sections development, responsive layout design, and animation implementation for enhanced user experience.",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a content-focused task with some UI components. The complexity is moderate since it involves creating responsive layouts and some animations, but doesn't require complex state management or data processing."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Project Showcase Grid Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the project showcase implementation into data structure design, card component creation, filtering system development, and detailed project view implementation with optimized images.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both UI development and data management with filtering functionality. The combination of responsive grid layout, filtering system, and detailed project views with optimized images increases complexity."
    },

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "MDX Configuration for Blog System",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the MDX blog system setup into MDX configuration and routing, syntax highlighting implementation, metadata extraction system, table of contents generation, and custom MDX component development.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up an MDX-based blog system involves multiple technical challenges including file-based routing, metadata parsing, custom component integration, and syntax highlighting. This requires understanding of both Next.js App Router and MDX ecosystem."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Blog Listing and Filtering Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the blog listing page development into post preview components, pagination system, search functionality implementation, and category filtering system.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple interactive features (pagination, search, filtering) that work together with the blog data system. The complexity comes from ensuring these features work efficiently with potentially large numbers of blog posts."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Blog Post Detail Page Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the blog post detail page into MDX rendering implementation, interactive table of contents with highlighting, social sharing functionality, and related posts recommendation system.",
      "reasoning": "This task builds on the MDX configuration but focuses on the reading experience. The complexity comes from implementing the interactive table of contents with scroll highlighting and the related posts system based on categories."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Newsletter Integration with Brevo API",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the newsletter integration into form component with validation, secure API route implementation for Brevo, and response handling with appropriate user feedback.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves third-party API integration with form handling and validation. While not extremely complex, it requires careful implementation of validation, error handling, and security considerations for the API route."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "SEO and Analytics Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the SEO implementation into metadata configuration for different page types, sitemap and RSS generation, analytics setup, and structured data implementation for rich search results.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans multiple aspects of the site and requires technical knowledge of SEO best practices, metadata implementation, and analytics setup. The complexity comes from ensuring consistent implementation across different page types."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Deployment and Performance Optimization",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the deployment and optimization process into Docker containerization, CI/CD pipeline setup, performance optimization techniques, monitoring implementation, and security configuration including SSL.",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it involves multiple DevOps concerns including containerization, CI/CD, performance optimization, security, and monitoring. Each of these areas requires specialized knowledge and careful implementation."
